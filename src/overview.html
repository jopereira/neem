		<p>A simple implementation of the Network-friendly Epidemic Multicast
		(NeEM) protocol. This implementation is open source. Go to the
		<a href="http://neem.sf.net">NeEM homepage</a> for licensing details,
		further documentation and download of the latest version.</p>

		<p>The NeEM library provides an implementation of epidemic multicast
(also called probabilistic or gossip-based) in wide-area networks by
using multiple TCP/IP connections in a non-blocking fashion. The
resulting overlay network is automatically managed by the protocol.</p>

<p>Epidemic multicast protocols achieve stable high throughput
regardless of node and network faults and scale to very large numbers
of participants. The resulting protocol can be used for event
dissemination to a very large number of interested parties.</p>

<p>Implementation is based on Java5 and takes advantage of the NIO
interfaces to maintain multiple network connections without threading
overhead. The goal of this implementation is to be small, 
self-contained, and practical.</p>

<p>Look at package {@link net.sf.neem} for a simple and safe application programming
interface. Package {@link net.sf.neem.impl} contains protocol building blocks
that can be used to build customized epidemic protocols.</p>
